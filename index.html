      <h2>We cheese you!</h2>
      <p>Here at Pizzachu, we subscribe to the philosophy of their is no bad pizza. Every topping is wanted just as much as the last. We carry this mentality over to our customers too, and offer a phrase of affirmation or a "dad" joke with each purchase!</p>

      <h3>The Squirtle!</h3>
      <p>The squirtle is our sauciest pizza! This pizza comes with alfredo sauce as the base, has the same mix of mozzerella and asiago cheese that the Charmander comes with. With no other tradtional toppings adding, we put a swirl of pesto, buffalo, AND garlic parmisian on top, making this the most moist pizza you've ever seen! But we're not done there! This pizza also comes with pizza sauce on the side for you to dip your pizza slices in!</p>

## Description

The Pizza Parlor that I chose to make is called Pizzachu. It's a Pokemon themed pizza joint. With four specials, and multiple items that you can order. The specials are the Charmander, Bulbasaur, Squirtle, and Pokeball!

## Setup/Installation Requirements

To access the code in a text editor:

* Open your terminal or your gitBash
* Choose where you would like the code, and enter the directory/ folder with the cd function.
* (Optional) if you aren't sure where to put it you can make a directory to put it in temporarily by typing in mkdir putting a space, and then putting what you wish to call it. EXM:"mkdir clone" then hit enter to create the directory. Once the directory is made, use the command "cd clone" and press enter.
* Once you are in the directory/ folder you wish to clone the webpage too, type on a new line. "git clone https://github.com/AlesandriaWild/Mr-Robogers-Neighborhood.git" and hit enter.
* Now type in "code ." and press enter again.
* Your text editior should now open so you can access the code.
